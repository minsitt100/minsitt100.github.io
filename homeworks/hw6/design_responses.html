					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Animations should be quick, but not too slow as to keep the user waiting. 
								It was cool to see how research has shown that the optimal speed is 200 ms - 500 ms.
							    Size of the object also matters with movement distance. Make sure to exclude any bouncing effects when sliding up</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I loved learning about the little nuances these animation effects can bring.
								For instance, making the animation curves fit the intention of the product feature, by making it 
							exponential to indicate a permanent decision. It's something I hand't thought about before reading this article </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
