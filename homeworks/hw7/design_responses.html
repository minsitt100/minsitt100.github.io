						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> In this article I learned about Geshalts principles and how we can statregically use shapes
								to create images and patterns that can be recognized by general viewers. We have these principles to help
								design be more intuitive and friendly to people (e.g proximity principle helps communicate that the designs are related). These concepts
								help us guide our design to make it flow better and easier to digest.
								 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I loved how they show the pictures of mock-up UI designs with each principle. Seeing it laid out via colors was also nice as I could pretend
								I was user and check my own assumptions to see that the principles were actually working. I assumed content was grouped together as intended when they showed
								examples of proximity principle in U.I.

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
