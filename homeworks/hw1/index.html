            I am currently a junior and I am originally from Yangon, Myanmar which is a country 
            in Southeast Asia. 
            I've been to 38 countries, and my favorite food is Mala Xiang Guo! (Dry stir fried hot pot)

        <h4> Below are my responses for Part 2:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>1. I learned about the factors that go into design and really thinking about how you present the information available to you. 
                Actually using the app or website and thinking about why certain information is presented the way they are is really good advice! </p></li>
            <li><p>2. My favoruite part of the article was the examples the author shown of her breaking down the apps
                and analyzing why certain information was presented. It gives me good inspiration on what I should look out for 
                in my future work.
